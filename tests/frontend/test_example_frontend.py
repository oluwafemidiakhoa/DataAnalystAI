# Testing Streamlit components directly within unit tests is often difficult.
# You might focus on testing the helper functions used by your Streamlit pages.
# For end-to-end testing of the UI, tools like Selenium or Playwright might be considered,
# but that's outside the scope of basic unit testing with pytest.

# Add more tests for frontend utility functions...
